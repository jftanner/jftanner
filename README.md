It appears that you've stumbled onto nearly-empty GitHub profile. Alas, there's not much to see here. Despite over a decade of experience, most of my work for the last several years has been on proprietary code. I've made my older repos private, since they don't reflect my current abilities.

- To see what I've been up to lately, or get in touch, check out my [LinkedIn].
- If you're a hiring manager or recruiter who found this by Googling me, you should definitely go ahead and interview me. :)

### About Me
- **Pronouns:** She/Her or He/Him. (_It varies by context, so either is generally acceptable._)
- **Fun Fact:** My HomeLab runs Kubernetes just for fun. I also love RegEx. I'm _that_ kind of nerd.
